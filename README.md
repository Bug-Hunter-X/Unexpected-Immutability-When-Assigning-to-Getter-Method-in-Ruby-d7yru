This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby related to instance variable access and modification using getter methods.  The code in `bug.rb` shows how assigning a new value to the result of the `value` getter method doesn't affect the internal `@value` variable.  The solution, in `bugSolution.rb`, demonstrates the correct approach using a setter method or modifying the instance variable directly.
